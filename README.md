# Prisma 2 Docs

This repository currently contains the documentation for Prisma 2 which is currently in _Preview_. Once Prisma 2 is released for _General Availability_, the docs will be moved into respective locations on prisma.io.

> Prisma 2 is currently in Preview! [Limitations](https://github.com/prisma/prisma2-docs/blob/master/limitations.md) include missing features, limited performance and stability issues.

## Getting started

The easiest way to get started with [Photon](https://github.com/prisma/photonjs) and/or [Lift](https://github.com/prisma/lift) is by installing the Prisma CLI and running the interactive `init` command:

```
npm install -g prisma2
prisma2 init hello-prisma
```

The interactive prompt will ask you to provide database credentials for your database. If you don't have a database yet, select **SQLite** and let the CLI set up a database file for you.

Learn more about the `prisma2 init` flow [here](./getting-started.md).
